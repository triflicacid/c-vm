# C Virtual Machine

Basic virtual machine written in C.

For more informations, see `docs/`, `tests/`.

## Components
- Basic "CPU" (*in progress*)

### TODO
- Print to STDOUT (using memory mapping to map characters?)
- Opcode documentation? (explained in `opcodes.h` - maybe write a more general overview?)
- Basic assembly script and assembler

## Goal
The goal of this repo is to build a basic virtual machine with I/O, equipped with a custom assembler, and a C-like language to accompany it.
